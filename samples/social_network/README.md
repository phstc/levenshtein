# Problem

Two words are friends if they have a [Levenshtein distance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance) of 1. That is, you can add, remove, or substitute exactly one letter in word X to create word Y. A word’s social network  consists of all of its friends, plus all of their friends, and all of their friends’ friends, and so on. Write a program to tell us how big the social network for the word “causes” is, using this word list [github.com/causes/puzzles/raw/master/word_friends/word.list](https://github.com/causes/puzzles/raw/master/word_friends/word.list).
